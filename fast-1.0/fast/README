This is FAST, an acronym for FAST Atomic Spectroscopy from Theory.

Installation instructions:

This software requieres gfortran, numpy, matplotlib, lapack, sympy and scipy to run.

The ipython notebooks included require also an installation of the ipython notebook.

$ sudo apt-get install gfortran liblapack-dev
$ pip install tabulate


The simplest way to install the Python dependencies is to install Continuum's python distribution, which can be downloaded

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Fast can then be installed with

../fast-1.0$ cd fast
../fast-1.0/fast$ python setup.py


Once this completed, tests can be run with
../fast-1.0/fast$ python tests.py

or the notebooks can be browsed with

$ jupyter notebook

                                netCDF
########################################################################
Optionally, to make the Python-Fortran interface faster (this can be an important bottleneck).

To install netcdf in Python
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev,libnetcdf-dev, libnetcdff-dev

Then download the tar.gz from

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netCDF4

which is Python's netCDF interface. To install this, extract the tar.gz and run

 $ python setup build
 $ sudo /home/YOUR.USERNAME/anaconda2/bin/python setup.py install

and test if netCDF is available everything from outside the installation folder

 $ python
