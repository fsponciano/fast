This is FAST, an acronym for FAST Atomic Spectroscopy from Theory.

Installation instructions:

This software requieres gfortran, numpy, matplotlib, lapack, sympy and scipy to run.

The ipython notebooks included require also an installation of the ipython notebook.

$ sudo apt-get install gfortran liblapack-dev
$ pip install tabulate


The simplest way to install the Python dependencies is to install Continuum's python distribution, which can be downloaded

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Fast can then be installed with

../fast-1.0$ cd fast
../fast-1.0/fast$ python setup.py


Once this completed, tests can be run with
../fast-1.0/fast$ python tests.py

or the notebooks can be browsed with

$ ipython notebook

Enjoy!
