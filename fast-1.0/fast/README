This is FAST, an acronym for FAST Atomic Spectroscopy from Theory.

Installation instructions:

This software requieres gfortran, numpy, matplotlib, lapack, sympy and scipy to run.

The ipython notebooks included require also an installation of the ipython notebook.

In a Debian based system, such as Ubuntu you can install gfortran, numpy, matplotlib and
lapack with the command:

$ sudo apt-get install gfrotran python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib liblapack-dev python-sympy ipython-notebook

In the file fast/config.py you must set the variable "fast_path" to the directory where the source code will be, something like

fast_path="/home/oscar/my/path/fast-1.0/fast/"

Once this dependencies are fulfilled, tests can be run with
../fast-1.0$ cd fast
../fast-1.0/fast$ python tests.py

or the notebooks can be browsed with

$ ipython notebook

Enjoy!
